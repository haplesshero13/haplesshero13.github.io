# Avery Yen
Hi, I'm Avery. I'm a longtime product engineer turned AI researcher. I'm a Research Assistant to David Bau, a member of MIT AI Alignment (MAIA), and pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University, studying human-AI interaction and AI safety.

Before transitioning to AI research, I spent over 12 years as a software engineer, with my longest tenure at Pivotal Labs.

## Research Interests

I believe understanding how AI systems behave with and against human interests is the most fundamental and urgent AI research question.

I develop tools and studies that help humans understand, audit, and shape AI systems to benefit all humans.

### Selected Projects
- [Multi-Agent Social Deception Arena](https://lmdeceptionarena.averyyen.dev/) (project lead): Evaluation platform for testing strategic deception and persuasion capabilities in frontier LLMs using a well-loved social deduction game. Live leaderboard continuously benchmarks ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, and other models. Forthcoming study of long-horizon multi-turn social gaming.

- OpenClaw/Agentic AI study - forthcoming work.

- [National Deep Inference Fabric](https://ndif.us): The NSF National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF) is a research computing project that enables researchers and students to perform mechanistic interpretability research on models, with sizes up to a 405B parameter open-weight model.


## Other Interests
I've been playing classical cello since I was about 7, having previously subbed with the Boston Philharmonic, and continue to play today as part of the [Mercury Orchestra](https://www.mercuryorchestra.org/) and various other groups.
