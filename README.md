# Avery Yen

Hi, I'm Avery. I'm a first year MS candidate in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern university, where I currently work as a Research Assistant to Professor David Bau at the [National Deep Inference Fabric](https://ndif.us), studying language model interpretability.

Before that, I spent over 12 years as a software engineer, with my longest tenure at Pivotal Labs (now VMWare).

## Research Interests

tl;dr **What *can* AI do for us, and what are the *right things* to do with AI, and can we intersect those two things?**

Is the AI field solving the right problems? The AI community often celebrates bigger, faster, more powerful models, but I seek to answer what we *should* be building. If we can recover insights from AI systems, we stand to gain a lot of insights into real problems facing the world today, whether it's climate, healthcare, or basic science.
