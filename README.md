# This Is Our Black Swan Event

Hi, I'm Avery. I care about ethical use of technology and the future of humanity as we learn to coexist with AI.

I currently work as a Research Assistant to Professor David Bau at Northeastern working on the (National Deep Inference Fabric)[https://ndif.us], studying language model interpretability.

This blog is titled as such because I believe this generation's black swan event is the rise of powerful AI systems.

As I write about how I got into AI Interpretability, you can follow along and copy my learning curriculum:
