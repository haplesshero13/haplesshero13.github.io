# This Is Our Black Swan Moment

Hi, I'm Avery. I care about ethical use of technolgy and the future of humanity as we learn to coexist with AI.

I currently work as a Research Assistant to Professor David Bau at Northeastern/NDIF, studying language model interpretability.

This blog is titled as such because I believe this generation's black swan event is the rise of powerful AI systems.

Follow along as I become an interpreter and wrangler of black swan systems myself:
