# Avery Yen

Hi, I'm Avery. I care about ethical use of technology and the future of humanity as we increasingly coexist with AI.

As a first year MS candidate in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern university, I currently work as a Research Assistant to Professor David Bau at the [National Deep Inference Fabric](https://ndif.us), studying language model interpretability.

Before that, I spent over 12 years as a software engineer, with my longest tenure at Pivotal Labs (now VMWare).

## Research Interests

tl;dr **What *can* AI do for us, and what are the *right things* to do with AI, and can we intersect those two things?**

Is the AI field solving the right problems? The AI community often celebrates bigger, faster, more powerful models, but I seek to answer what we *should* be building. At the same time, AI capability has grown and yet, many societal and environmental problems are *technically achievable today* yet remain unsolved.

AI is a tool by and for humans, so we must interrogate how to recover human biases and values we've encoded, improve training data attribution, and study the effects of safety and censorship training inside the black box of LLMs.

Additionally, if we can recover insights from AI systems, we stand to gain a lot of insights into real problems facing the world today, whether it's climate, healthcare, or basic science.
