# Avery Yen

Hi, I'm Avery. I'm a Research Assistant to Professor David Bau at the [National Deep Inference Fabric](https://ndif.us), where I study interpretability of large language models.

Before that, I spent over 12 years as a software engineer, with my longest tenure at [Pivotal Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Labs).

## Research Interests

**Transparent, interpretable, trustable AI Systems**

I believe that understanding how AI systems understand the world and make decisions is essential for building technology we can trust and rely on.

I am currently interested in how adversarial behaviors in LLM pre- and post-training can be understood, detected, and mitigated.

## Selected Projects

- Reasoning Training for Small Language Models (~1B): Independent project to develop an efficient, near-SotA post-training recipe for 1B language models under limited computation budgets (ongoing)

- [National Deep Inference Fabric](https://ndif.us): The NSF National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF) is a research computing project that enables researchers and students to perform mechanistic interpretability research on models, with sizes up to a 405B parameter open-weight model.
