First, I followed 1.1 of ARENA. Honestly, a lot of the foundations in Chapter 0 were not as helpful to me, since I had enough Python background, and the exercises in Chapter 0 were a little random in sequence, they seem more useful as a look-back reference later, for when I need to learn something specific. So I skipped to 1.1

I found a helpful coursera course called Math for Machine Learning. It's great for when you need to look back to get some foundations in a math concept. You'll probably need some high school algebra, probability, and intro calculus to learn some of this math well enough to follow along, but it's all very rusty for me, and I have squeaked by.
